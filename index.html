        <div class="frstletter">N</div>orthern California Volleyball Officials Association of Chico (NCVOA-Chico)
        is a nonprofit organization to provide volleyball officials to officiate at Northern California high schools.
        Merrilee Johnson founded NCVOA-Chico in 1975 after local coaches recruited her to better the volleyball
        officiating in the area. In 2000 she stepped down, and we created a Board to continue running the association.
        Our association travels from as far north as Red Bluff to as far south as Winters. Lassen High School in Susanville
        is our most eastern school, and Elk Creek High School is to the west. Our goal is to provide the local high schools
        with officials with thorough training and knowledge of the sport of volleyball.
